"note/Diane Jackson-Richards, Amit G. Pandya (eds.) - Dermatology Atlas for Skin of Color-Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2014)_00020_00168_0.png","Vitiligo is separated into two main variants, each with a different presentation and clinical course. Non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), also called generalized vitiligo, is the most common form, seen in approximately 90% of cases, and is generally more rapidly progressive in its course than segmental vitiligo. Non-segmental vitiligo presents with depigmented macules and patches that occur in a bilateral distribution anywhere on the body but typically involves the face, axillary regions, dorsal hands, fingers, and feet. Early lesions of vitiligo often have small depigmented lesions around larger lesions. New areas of vitiligo commonly occur over joints particularly of the hands, elbows, and knees. When depigmentation occurs secondary to trauma or chronic pressure, it is known as the Koebner phenomenon. Occasionally, the depigmentation can have a transitional stage, known as trichrome vitiligo, in which normal, hypopigmented, and depigmented skin is present in the same location. Segmental vitiligo (SV) is less common than NSV and typically begins at a younger age, with roughly 30% of cases presenting during childhood. Segmental vitiligo is characterized by unilateral or localized depigmentation that can spread along the distribution of a dermatome or along Blaschko’s lines. Spread of SV to the contralateral side of the body is rare, and lesions tend to be more stable than those of generalized vitiligo.","Vitiligo is separated into two main variants, each with a different presentation and clinical course.
