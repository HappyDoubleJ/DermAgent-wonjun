IIYI/30412_3.png,"The post discusses various aspects of urticaria (hives), including its causes, mechanisms, and clinical manifestations. Causes of urticaria can be multifactorial, often elusive, especially in chronic cases. Potential triggers include medications like penicillin and aspirin, foods with specific proteins (e.g., fish, eggs, milk), infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic), inhalants (pollen, dust), physical and chemical factors (temperature changes, sunlight, friction, pressure), genetic predispositions, hormonal or psychological changes, and underlying medical conditions like lymphoma or thyroid disorders. The post describes two types of mechanisms behind urticaria: allergic reactions and non-allergic direct cellular responses leading to symptoms such as swelling, redness, itch, and in severe cases, systemic symptoms like fever and headache. The forum discussion expands on the clinical presentation and symptomatic treatment of urticaria. Urticaria manifests as itchy, red welts or swellings on the skin, often resolving within hours to days but can persist or recur. Acute cases feature rapid onset with potential systemic symptoms like fever and may resolve within about two weeks, while chronic urticaria involves persistent or recurrent symptoms lasting months to years. Treatment focuses on identifying triggers and managing symptoms with antihistamines and, in severe cases, emergency interventions like epinephrine for anaphylactic reactions. Preventive measures include avoiding known allergens and dietary adjustments to decrease histamine release. Persistent cases may require a combination of medications to achieve control and desensitization.","The post discusses various aspects of urticaria (hives), including its causes, mechanisms, and clinical manifestations. Causes of urticaria can be multifactorial, often elusive, especially in chronic cases. Potential triggers include medications like penicillin and aspirin, foods with specific proteins (e.g., fish, eggs, milk), infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic), inhalants (pollen, dust), physical and chemical factors (temperature changes, sunlight, friction, pressure), genetic predispositions, hormonal or psychological changes, and underlying medical conditions like lymphoma or thyroid disorders. The post describes two types of mechanisms behind urticaria: allergic reactions and non-allergic direct cellular responses leading to symptoms such as swelling, redness, itch, and in severe cases, systemic symptoms like fever and headache.

The cause can be an allergic reaction, infection, or physical stimulus, and is often triggered by the release of histamine, bradykinin, and pro-inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils. These molecules cause capillaries and venules to leak, resulting in an edema that lasts until absorbed by surrounding cells. In some cases, urticaria can be chronically recurrent and is also associated with autoimmune diseases.","This image depicts urticaria, an itchy swelling of the skin also known as wheals or hives, caused by an edema or swelling in the superficial layer of the skin.

Pandya (eds.) - Dermatology Atlas for Skin of Color-Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2014)_00020_00168_0.png","Vitiligo is separated into two main variants, each with a different presentation and clinical course. Non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), also called generalized vitiligo, is the most common form, seen in approximately 90% of cases, and is generally more rapidly progressive in its course than segmental vitiligo. Non-segmental vitiligo presents with depigmented macules and patches that occur in a bilateral distribution anywhere on the body but typically involves the face, axillary regions, dorsal hands, fingers, and feet. Early lesions of vitiligo often have small depigmented lesions around larger lesions. New areas of vitiligo commonly occur over joints particularly of the hands, elbows, and knees. When depigmentation occurs secondary to trauma or chronic pressure, it is known as the Koebner phenomenon. Occasionally, the depigmentation can have a transitional stage, known as trichrome vitiligo, in which normal, hypopigmented, and depigmented skin is present in the same location. Segmental vitiligo (SV) is less common than NSV and typically begins at a younger age, with roughly 30% of cases presenting during childhood. Segmental vitiligo is characterized by unilateral or localized depigmentation that can spread along the distribution of a dermatome or along Blaschko’s lines. Spread of SV to the contralateral side of the body is rare, and lesions tend to be more stable than those of generalized vitiligo.","Vitiligo is separated into two main variants, each with a different presentation and clinical course.

It is more prevalent in humid climates and occurs most commonly in the summer months. Trauma to the skin, such as a small abrasion or insect bite, sometimes provides the site of entry for the infective bacteria. The lesions evolve from discrete small vesicles into pustules. The fluid content of the primary lesions dries into a thick yellowish crust, and removal of the crust may reveal bright-red and shiny erosions. The most common cause of impetigo is Staphylococcus aureus. Because the “honey-crusted” lesions of impetigo may be caused by a combination of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, systemic antibiotic therapy should be effective against both organisms. The use of topical mupirocin ointment appears to be an effective treatment and may replace the need for systemic therapy in some patients with localized lesions.","Impetigo is a primary superficial infection of the skin.
